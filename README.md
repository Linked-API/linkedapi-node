This official Node.js SDK is the fastest and most reliable way to integrate with Linked API. It simplifies development by providing pre-defined methods for common scenarios, handling authentication, managing state persistence, and structuring error responses.

## Get started
To get started with Linked API Node.js SDK, read these essential guides first. Spending **~20 minutes** on them now will save you **hours of debugging** later:

1. [Core concepts](https://linkedapi.io/sdks/core-concepts-0/) – understand the fundamentals of how Linked API works.
2. [Installation & authorization](https://linkedapi.io/sdks/installation-authorization/) – get the SDK installed and learn how to authorize it.
3. [Predefined vs. custom workflows](https://linkedapi.io/sdks/predefined-vs-custom-workflows/) – learn when to use ready-made methods and when to build your own custom logic.
4. [Handling results and errors](https://linkedapi.io/sdks/handling-results-and-errors/) – see how to process successful results and errors.
5. [Persisting and cancelling workflows](https://linkedapi.io/sdks/persisting-and-cancelling-workflows/) – learn how to save, resume, and cancel workflows.
